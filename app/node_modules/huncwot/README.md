## Rationale

Huncwot is being built with *battery included* approach in mind, i.e. it comes with a (eventually large) library of useful modules which are developed in a coherent way. This stands in direct opposition to Koa approach. Huncwot tries to formalize conventions and eliminate valueless choices by providing solid defaults for building web applications that increase the programmers productivity.

Huncwot fights against [the accidental complexity](https://wiki.c2.com/?AccidentalComplexity). Let's focus on business needs of our applications instead of constantly configuring, patching and putting together various software elements.

## Features In A Nutshell

Huncwot bridges client-side (*frontend*) and server-side (*backend*) development
by using [a single programming language - JavaScript - across the
board](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9).

The project draws inspiration from Rails while trying to be less *magical*, if
any at all. In Huncwot, you write your applications using
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It also comes with a convenient
command toolkit (CLI) which wraps over `npm scripts`

As a secondary goal, Huncwot tries to minimize the dependencies. It uses
external packages only if absolutely necessary (e.g. security, OS abstractions
etc).

* [Folder-By-Feature Directory Structure](#folder-by-feature-directory-structure)

## Getting Started

Install `huncwot` globally to use its CLI commands which simplify frequent operations.

```
npm install -g huncwot
```

Generate new application

```
huncwot new my-project
```

Open the application in Visual Studio Code

```
code my-project
```

Use the `Tasks: Run Task` from the Command Palette to select a Huncwot command

> It is a good idea to bind `CTRL-T` to `Tasks: Run Task` for convenience.

![Huncwot Zap: Run Task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaiste/huncwot/master/docs/zaps/huncwot-run-task.gif)

A Huncwot application consists of a front-end & back-end, both run as separate processes. 

Use the `Server` task to start the back-end process:

![Huncwot Zap: Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaiste/huncwot/master/docs/zaps/huncwot-server.gif)

> The server runs on the port `5544`

Use the `Client` task to start the front-end process

![Huncwot Zap: Client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaiste/huncwot/master/docs/zaps/huncwot-client.gif)

> The server runs on the port `10001`

Or, use the `start` command to start the both processes at the same time. This
is usually the default approach.

## Features In Detail

### Folder-By-Feature Directory Structure

The directory structure in Huncwot is organized around your application **features**, and not **by type**. This means that artifacts, either client-side or server-side are kept together. In other words, this approach groups together entities (classes, functions) that actually work together. This leads to high modularity of your application and better cohesion.

The *Folder-By-Feature* approach makes it easier to find files in your application directory. It is especially visible once your project grows - folder-by-feature is a better long-term approach due its scalability.

To some extend, the *Folder-By-Feature* approach is similar to how recent frontend libraries and frameworks (React, Vue, etc) group together HTML, JavaScript and Stylesheets. In Huncwot, this simply goes one step further by applying a similar technique to the entire application so that it covers both frontend and backend.

### Built-in Authentication

bcrypt lacks memory hardness while in scrypt both, memory hardness and iteration count are tied to a single cost factor. On top of that, Argon2 won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015. It is build around AES ciphers, is resistant to ranking tradeoff attacks and more...

### Data-driven Handler Abstractions

Contrary to Express.js (and similar frameworks), a **handler** in Huncwot is a *one argument* function. This argument is the incoming request.

```js
// An example of a handler
const browse = request => {
  return { ... } // <- the return value is used by Huncwot to create an HTTP response
}
```

In Express, and the majority of other Node.js frameworks, handlers take two arguments. The first one is the request and the second one is the response.



In Huncwot, the response is simply everything that is being returned by the handler. This way, it may be slightly more natural to think about the process of handling requests and generating responses: handlers are functions, which take requests as their input and produce responses as their output. The response is represented as a JavaScript object which must have at least the `body` key.

```js
const fetch = request => {
  return { body: 'Hello, Huncwot!' }
}
```

The return value can be a string. In that case the response is `200 OK` with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`, e.g.

```js
const say = request => {
  return 'This is nice'
}
```

Usually the value returned by a handler is an object with (at least) the `body` property. Optionally, you can also specify the `headers`, `statusCode` or `type` properties. This constitutes the `Handler` type.

```ts
import { Handler } from 'huncwot';

const fetch: Handler = request => {
  return {
    body: '<h1>Hello World</h1>',
    type: 'text/html',
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {}
  }
}
```

Huncwot uses plain objects (a regular data structure in JavaScript) to represent HTTP responses. That's why we say it's a data-driven (and declarative) approach. This is inspired by the ring library from the Clojure community.

In some relatively rare cases, the response can be also a stream. Huncwot sets the `type` automatically to `application/octet-stream` in that event.

### Wrappers For Common HTTP Responses

It would be arduous to create an object with the specific fields each time an HTTP response is needed. Huncwot provides convenient wrappers in that situation.

Instead of writing:

```ts
import { Handler } from 'huncwot';

const fetch: Handler = request => {
  return {
    body: '<h1>Hello World</h1>',
    type: 'text/html',
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {}
  }
}
```

you can use the `HTMLString` wrapper and write this:

```ts
import { Handler } from 'huncwot';
import { HTMLString } from 'huncwot/response';

const fetch: Handler = request => {
  return HTMLString('<h1>Hello World</h1>')
}
```

### Set The Preferred Response Format

Huncwot determines the preferred response format from either the HTTP `Accept`
header or `format` query string parameter, submitted by the client. The `format`
query parameter takes precedence over the HTTP `Accept` header.

Based on the preferred format, you can construct actions that handle several
possibilities at once using just the JavaScript's `switch` statement - no
special syntax needed.

```js
const browse = ({ format }) => {
  // ... the action body

  switch (format) {
    case 'html':
      // provide a response as a HTML Page
      return HTMLString(...)
    case 'csv':
      // provide a response as in CSV format
      return CSVPayload(...)
    default:
      // format not specified
      return JSONPayload(...)
  }

}
```

### Reusable workflows through the function composition

Handlers can be composed from simple functions so that the shared bevahior can be extracted into reusable chunks of code. Such composition creates workflows that can contain validation, logging, profiling, permission checking or throttling.

```js
import { validate } from 'huncwot/request';

GET: {
  '/request-validation': [
    validate({ name: { type: String, required: true } }),
    ({ params: { admin } }) =>
      `Admin param (${admin}) should be absent from this request payload`
  ]
}
```

You can also add global middlewares.

```js
let id = 0, sequence = () => id++

app.use(async (context, next) => {
  const { request } = context
  request.id = sequence()
  return next(context)
})
```

### Server-side Router

In Huncwot, you can define implicit routes that are derived from the application features. These are called *Resource* routes and they can be configured in `config/server/routes.ts` under the `Resources` key.

```
```

Each resource expects a controller in the `features/<feature name>/Controller` directory. This controller consists of 1 to 5 actions that may be defined in separate files.

Let's say we have a `Game` feature. If we define a `Game` resource as described above, this configuration will implicitly generate the five following routes:

Name | File in `features/` | HTTP Method | Default Path
--- | --- | :---: | ---
**C**reate | `Game/Controller/create.ts` | `POST` | `/game`
**B**rowse | `Game/Controller/browse.ts` | `GET` | `/game`
**F**etch | `Game/Controller/fetch.ts` | `GET` | `/game/:id`
**U**pdate | `Game/Controller/update.ts` | `PUT` | `/game/:id`
**D**estroy | `Game/Controller/destroy.ts` | `DELETE` | `/game/:id`

The action names create a C**BF**UD acronym, an extension of CRUD approach, where we explicitly differentiate between reading a single element and reading a potentially filtered collection of elements.

Actions are responsible to connect the information received from the incoming request to underlaying data in your application (i.e. fetching/saving/updating) in order to produce a corresponding view e.g. a HTML page or a JSON payload.

### Parameters

There are two kinds of parameters possible in a web application: the ones that are sent as part of the URL after `?`, called *query string* parameters; and the ones that are sent as part of the request `body`, referred to as POST data (usually comes from an HTML form or as JSON). Huncwot does not make any distinction between query string parameters and POST parameters, both are available in the request `params` object.


### Background Processing

Huncwot provides a simple and efficient background processing in Node.js using the [graphile-worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker) package.

The task are written in TypeScript and put by name on the task queues along with the necessary payload.

```ts
const SendEmail: Task = async input => {
  const { name } = input;

  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```

By convention, the task names in Huncwot are written in Camel Case with the first letter uppercase: think, this is a `SendEmail` task.

Each task must be placed in a separate file within the `tasks/` directory at the root of your Huncwot project, e.g. `tasks/SendEmail.ts` for the task above.

This background processing mechanism is integrated directly into PostgreSQL (it requires PostgreSQL 10 or higher). You may wonder why not use Redis or something similar. The answer is **simplicity**. Putting the job/task queues in a relational database is minimally less performant than Redis while providing a significant convenience for the application maintenance: there is less elements to install, manage and configure when running your application.

Also, you can use SQL, a familiar interface to query about tasks & queues statuses instead of learning yet another domain specific language as, for example, in the case of Redis. Simplicity for the win.

You can run the background processing mechanism using the `background` command:

```bash
huncwot background
```

There is also a convenient `bg` alias for that:

```
hc bg
```

From now on you can schedule tasks. The process of scheduling consists of putting the task name along with its input payload on a task queue. This is usually done from within your application in response to some activity, e.g. you send a welcome email once a user registers, etc.

```ts
Background.schedule({ task: SendEmail });
```

For some tasks you may need to provide some input data (the payload) so that they execute properly:

```ts
Background.schedule({
  task: SendEmail
  payload: { to: 'admin@example.com' }
});
```

By default the task is scheduled on a new queue, i.e. the queue name is randomly generated. This means that the worker executes tasks in parallel if there is enough throughput (CPUs).

You may need to force an execution order for certain tasks. In this case you need to schedule those tasks on the same queue so that they run serially:

```ts
Background.schedule({
  task: SendEmail,
  queue: Queue.for('email')
});
```

Lastly, you can schedule tasks via the CLI. This is useful while in development to quickly test if tasks execute as planned:

```bash
huncwot background schedule <name> [payload]
```

The `name` parameter is a mandatory task name, e.g. `SendEmail` while the `payload` parameter is an optional JSON payload as `string`.

```bash
hc bg schedule SendEmail '{ "to": "admin@example.com" }'
```


## Usage

Huncwot can be used as a replacement for Express or Koa, but it also goes beyond that by providing opinionated choices to other layers in the stack (view, ORM, etc) required to build a fully functional web application.

There are two essential ways in Huncwot to construct a web application: traditional server-side or modern component-based. Nonetheless, those two approaches can be combined in any proportion.

### Server-side

This is an example of a basic server-side application in Huncwot. Save it to a file e.g. `server.js`, run it with `node server.js` and visit the application `https://localhost:5544`.

> *Note* Don't forget to install `huncwot` by adding it to `package.json` in your project directory followed by `npm install`. If you're starting from scratch, use `npm init` or (better) `huncwot new` described below.

```js
const Huncwot = require('huncwot');
const { OK } = require('huncwot/response');

const app = new Huncwot();

const routes = {
  get: {
    '/': _ => 'Hello Huncwot', // implicit `return` with a `text/plain` response
    '/json': _ => OK({ a: 1, b: 2 }), // explicit `return` with a 200 response of `application/json` type
    '/headers': _ => ({ body: 'Hello B', statusCode: 201, headers: { 'Authorization': 'PASS' } }) // set your own headers
  },
  post: {
    '/bim/': request => `Hello POST! ${request.params.name}` // request body is parsed in `params` by default
  }
}

app.start({ routes, port: 5544 });
```

This example shows a regular, server-side application. You define routes as a plain object, which makes composition easier. In contrast to Express, Huncwot handlers only take HTTP `request` as input and always return an HTTP response: either defined explicitly as an object with `body`, `status`, etc keys, or implicitly with an inferred type e.g. `text/plain` or as a wrapping function e.g. `OK()` for `200`, or `created()` for `201`.


## Concepts

### Database

An ORM is at times too much to get data out of the database. Huncwot provides an
thin layer of integration with various RDMBS systems using
[Sqorn](https://sqorn.org/). Thanks to this library you can
write usual SQL queries, yet fully integrated with the regular JavaScript data
structures.

The database configuration is stored `config/database.json` as a JSON document.

In order to start using the database integration you only need to require `huncwot/db`:

```
const db = require('huncwot/db');
```

Let's see how we can perform some basic and frequent SQL queries in Huncwot

#### Select

Get all elements with all columns from `widgets` table; equivalent to `select * from widgets`:

```
const results = await db`widgets`;
```

Get all elements with all some columns from `widgets` table; equivalent to `select id, name from widgets`:

```
const results = await db`widgets`.return('id', 'name');
```

Get a single element from `widgets` table by `id`:

```
const result = await db`widgets`.where({ id })
```

#### Insert/Update

Insert a single element into `widgets` table:

```
await db`widgets`.insert({ name: 'Widget 1', amount: 2 })
```

Insert few elements at once into `widgets` table:

```
await db`widgets`.insert([
  { name: 'Widget 1', amount: 2 },
  { name: 'Widget 2', amount: 7 },
  { name: 'Widget 3', amount: 4 }
])
```

Update an existing element (identified by `id`) in `widgets` table:

```
await db`widgets`.where({ id: 2 }).set({ name: 'Widget 22' })
```


## Examples

* [Huncwot Example App](https://github.com/zaiste/huncwot-example-app)
* [ToDo with Vue.js (Vuex, Vue Router), Node.js and TypeScript](https://github.com/zaiste/huncwot-component-app)

## Troubleshooting

### Outdated `node-gyp`

If you're getting an error similar to the following one:

```
TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'tuple' and 'str'
```

it means that the `node-gyp` is outdated. Run the following commands to solve it:


```
npm explore npm -g -- npm install node-gyp@latest
npm explore npm -g -- npm explore npm-lifecycle -- npm install node-gyp@latest
```
